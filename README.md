# Easy Weather

Easy Weather is an application for displaying the current weather. 

###How It Works
When loaded, the application finds the user's geolocation and makes a call using the geo coordinates to Open Weather's API to find the users weather.

If a user does not want to give the app permission to access their geolocation, they may type a zipcode which then makes a seperate call to Open Weather's API to find the weather of the specified location.

The application is built on a responsive grid using Foundation 5 to enhance mobile user experience.
